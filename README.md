### Favorite Team Sport: Football

I like football mostly because it requires a group of people to be **perfectly coordinated** with eachother to preform successfully. Now you might be thinking - "But don't all team sports require the team to be in sync with themselvels?" And you are correct, but in **football** you get to physically batter the other team, which is fun to watch.
